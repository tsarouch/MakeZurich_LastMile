# MakeZurich_LastMile

contribution to https://makezurich.ch (2018)

The challenge chosen: Conquering the Last Mile.
details here: https://makezurich.ch/box/4/


## Aim
Measure and visualize deliveries within the boundaries of a city. 

## Experimental Setups

- for the measuring part: hack box to simulate the transportation box.
This is the main challenge, to add electronics to the transfer box so that we monitor the conditions of the delivery.

- for the stable conditions ide: hack box to simulate the icebag-box.
The idea here is that instead of transfering critical products inside an empty box (where the conditions would be difficult to model and would vary alot according to outside temperature and number of objects inside the box) we transfer the products inside an ice bag.
Like this the low temperature will stay longer and the setup allow us to model the heat transfer so that we can predict critical delivery times.
